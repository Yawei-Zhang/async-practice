#async-practice

###Description

This repo compares several async functions, like `callback`, `Promise`, `Generator` and `async await`.

Thank for session chance, otherwise I would never do something like this. It help me a lot.

###Functionality

1. Request 'https://api.github.com/users/Yawei-Zhang' to get JSON data

2. Get next URL from JSON data, and request it again to get JSON data.

3. Print the final JSON data.
